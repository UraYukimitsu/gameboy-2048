gameboy-2048
============

A 2048 port to GameBoy using GBDK. This is still unfinished, but it is fully playable.

To play it, you'll need to compile it with GBDK (http://gbdk.sourceforge.net) version 2.95-3.
You can compile it using the make.bat script. Then, make sure you created a 2048 sub-directory in your GBDK installation directory and you placed all the source files in it.
Yeah, the soure code is really ugly, but GBDK is REALLY glitched. For example, in some random cases, it is impossile to write in 2 dimension arrays without using a pointer to this array...

I hope tou will enjoy it!

gameboy-2048
============

  A 2048 port to GameBoy using GBDK. This is still unfinished, but it is fully playable.

  To play it, you'll need to compile it with GBDK (http://gbdk.sourceforge.net) version 2.95-3.
You can compile it using the make.bat script. Then, make sure you created a 2048 sub-directory in your GBDK installation folder and you placed all the source files in it.
  You can also download it here : http://www.mediafire.com/download/1c7i679v595d73p/2048.gb but it may not be the latest version.

  Yeah, the source code is really ugly, but GBDK is REALLY glitched. For example, in some random cases, it is impossible to write in 2 dimension arrays without using a pointer to this array...

  I hope you will enjoy it!
  
  
  To do list:
    Undo [OK]
    High score [OK - Need to save it to keep it even after console shutdown]
    Game over detection [OK]
    Some animations

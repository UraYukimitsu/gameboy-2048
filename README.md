gameboy-2048
============

A 2048 port to GameBoy using GBDK. This is still unfinished, but it is fully playable.

To play it, you'll need to compile it with GBDK (http://gbdk.sourceforge.net) version 2.95-3.
Yeah, the soure code is really ugly, but GBDK is REALLY glitched. For example, in some random cases, it is impossile to write in 2 dimension arrays without using a pointer to this array...

I hope tou will enjoy it!
